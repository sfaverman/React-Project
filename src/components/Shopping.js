             <Video youtubeId ="2Kn1Ln0mSr4" />
             <p> Out of the class of San Diego malls, <b>Fashion Valley</b> has arguably the best of the upscale stores. Nordstrom, JC Penney, Macy&apos;s, Nieman Marcus, and San Diego&apos;s only Bloomingdale's anchor this well-appointed two-level outdoor mall. Where else will you find a Tiffany, Burberry, and Hermes store? Good restaurants and an AMC multiplex make this a place to go beyond shopping. </p><p><b>Tip:</b> Parking is easiest and plentiful in the south-side parking structures. </p>
